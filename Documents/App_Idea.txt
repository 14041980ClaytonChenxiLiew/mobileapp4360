•	I am a hairstylist who wants an app that can create different profiles for each of my clients.
• 	I want to be able to take pictures of my clients before and after I work with their hair and store those pictures under their profile.
•	I want to be able to view, edit, and store notes of each picture/hairstyles of my clients.
•	I want to be able to note the description of my clients to cater to their personalities & needs so that newer/less frequent clients feel remembered and important.  
•	I want to be able to schedule appointments with my clients on the app. I would like a calendar view to see my upcoming appointments and available time slots.
